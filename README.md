# AutomotitzacioCapacitatLocomotora

Wear OS app that allow to automate the measure of the intrinsic capacity following WHO ICOPE assessments.

It is planned to measure 3 tests:

- Chair rise test
- Balance test
- Walking speed

The 1st and the 2nd can be active measured starting the test, however it is intended that the app remembers the user to do so.
